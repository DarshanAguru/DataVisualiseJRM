# DashBoard

The Dashboard is just the the name suggest, It visualised the data for ease of understanding and gaining insights.
This is developed using Java Spring Boot that is serving as  api endpoint, MySql as DataBase adn React.js that is used as Front end FrameWork. SpringBoot makes it easy to create RESTful api that takes data from database and perfoemms operations and creates an API endpoint for front end to fetch the data. All this project is made from scratch and stil has lot of developments tobe made... 


## ðŸ†• Features

- DashBoard Shows the Data From the Database in Graphical Format.
- Filters are providede to gain proper insightss from the data.
- User can Filter the data by using Dropdown menu provided for each graph.
- graphs are color coded for better visualisation adn asthetic.


## ðŸ’» Technologies used
 - Front End: React.js , Chart.js, HTML, CSS
 - DataBase: MySql (using Xampp)
 - Backend : RESTful API using JAVA SpringBoot

## Data
 The Data is provided in CSV format as well as in SQL format.

## Installation
    - User needs to have Java EE from ecclipse (Recommended)
     or equivalent IDE, Node installed and Xampp for MYSql Database.
     
    - After installation user can load data in MySql Darabase using Xampp (Data already provided in repo.)

    - The serverRest folder contains the code related to spring boot, using Java IDE one can import that folder as Existing Maven Project. And can run this. (It runs on port 9000)

    - The visualise folder has the front end react code. User can run it using 
        > npm start
    command.(it will run on port no. 3000).

    - Thus the dashboard is read to use.
